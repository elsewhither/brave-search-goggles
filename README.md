# Library Goggles for Brave Search

This project is a result of wanting to test out the emerging Goggles feature of Brave Search for use in library reference and information services. Brave Goggles act as both filters and boosts to results on top of the default Brave search engine.

Library Goggles for Brave Search currently consists of two goggles: 

[1] Public Library Digital Services: 

Searches digital services for ebooks, audiobooks, and streaming media services that public libraries commonly use (i.e. Overdrive/Libby, Hoopla, Kanopy, etc.) as well as Openlibrary.org. The main purpose of this Goggle is to quickly check if a piece of media is available though a public library, before seeking more traditional interlibrary loan routes or purchasing it. 

[2] Academic Libraries & Libguides:

Boosts .edu domains that contain common academic library subdomains including linguine's. The purpose of this is to allow a hasty search of a topic either to guide reference resource retrieval or as a primer to further research. The subdomains are generalized from commonalities discovered when scrapping thousands of academic library we addresses from lib-web.org.

In the future additional Goggles may be added to the project. Currently the focus is remains on refining the results to further filter out bookstores and other unwanted pages.


## Usage
To use either of the Library Goggles, simply navigate to the respective links below:

[Public Library Digital Services](https://search.brave.com/goggles?goggles_id=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Felsewhither%2Fbrave-search-goggles%2Fmain%2Fpublic_library_digital_services.goggle)

[Academic Libraries & Libguides](https://search.brave.com/goggles?goggles_id=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Felsewhither%2Fbrave-search-goggles%2Fmain%2Facademic_libraries.goggle)

From there you just have to enter your search query and the Goggles should do the rest. Results that are influenced by the Goggle while have the color from its card next to it. If you hover the mouse over this, a pop-up will tell you which lines effected the result.
